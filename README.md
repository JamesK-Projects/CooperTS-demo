# "Hello, World!" With CooperTS

## What is CooperTS?

CooperTS is a custom expansion of TypeScript we built and use here at ExecOnline. Our original goal in creating it was to provide "no runtime failures while reducing testing burden." This project was set up as a quick window into basic functionality.

You can read more HERE.

## Setting up

First, clone down the repository. While in the directory of your choice:

```
git clone git@github.com:JamesK-Projects/CooperTS-demo.git
```

Second, install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Finally, start your React server:

```
yarn start

To switch the language, change the two-letter language code within the index.tsx file in the root directory.

"en" = English

"es" = Spanish

"fr" = French

"ja" = Japanese
